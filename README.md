# Final_Project
Introduction: 
Maternal mortality is an increasing issue throughout the world. Maternal mortality has become an increasing issue because there are concerns of health care system's ability to take care of women and provide adequate healthcare. It is a problem that has shown to increase due to social,economic, and cultural factors. In this specific app, state data and mortality rates are visualized to see the disparities between race and age and mortality rates over a period of time.

Data/operation abstraction design:
The data was provided by the Centers for Diesese and pretention(CDC). The data was not missing any values nor did it have any typos. The only preperation I did was removing unwanted variables for the graphs.

Future work:
In the future I plan to include a world cloud that incorporates user reponse of their takeaways from learning about maternal mortality. I would also include more forecasting of time series analysis to predict future maternal rates to help research for Maternal mortality. Visually I would want to add more of a visually pleasing qualities to draw the user in.
